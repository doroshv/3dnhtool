# 3DN_{H}-tool

This repository contains the code used to create the reddening data cube used within [3D$N_H$-tool](http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/nh3d/nhtool) and [bokeh](https://bokeh.org) app code (i.e. the tool itself). The data cube is hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10779060) to save space, so download separately.
